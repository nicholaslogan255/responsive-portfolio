            I am a Front End Web Developer. I discovered my talent for website creation when I took a web development course for my Computer
            Science degree. I saw the broad-reaching application of websites in a new way that I wanted to be involved in.
            Since then, I completed the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Coding Bootcamp, a twelve week, full-stack web developer
            certification program. During my time there, I worked independently and in groups to create diverse web applications.
            My strongest skills for web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a passion for solving puzzles and
            learning new solutions to resolving issues. I want to be a part of a highly motivated, intellectually driven
            team to create innovative software.
